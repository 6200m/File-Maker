The first 2 bytes are what I call the "header tag".
Every type of file that CMOC requests has one of these, and they are all unique.
For example, the first/<regionID>.ces file has the header tag of FD.

Next, there are 2 different 4 byte identifiers
CMOC has certain values it expects for each request.
For example, if the region ID for a FD tag was 49, the first one of these would
be 0x00000031 (49 in hexadecimal, big-endian)
The second one for a FD tag is 0x00000000

Before we continue, we need to talk about parallel universes /s

After that, there's 12 bytes of 0x00 unknown bytes, and 8 bytes of 0xFF
unknown bytes.

Then, there comes file specific tags.

There can be multiple file specific tags in each file
FD files only have 1 (FD again), but there are some files multiple (For example,
the popular Mii list files have PN, PC, and PM)

These vary between files, so documenting it here would be pointless.
