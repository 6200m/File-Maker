These scripts will create static data files for these Wii Channels:

<ul>
  <li>Everybody Votes Channel</li>
  <li>Forecast Channel</li>
  <li>News Channel</li>
</ul>

## Installing Requirements

Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder and it'll install. You might have to run as `sudo`.

It's required to have a `config.py` for scripts in the `Channels` folder. To find what you need to put for each one, look at `config.py.example`.
